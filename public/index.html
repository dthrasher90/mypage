        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p><img src="styles/images/family2.jpg" height="300px" width="240px">My name is Drew Thrasher, thanks for stopping by. I am a web developer and my family and I currently reside in Fairbanks, AK. Very shortly, we will be relocating to Salt Lake City,
            Utah to establish roots. We are very excited about the move and the chance to explore everything Utah has to offer. We are familiar with the area, having lived in Vegas for an extended time (my wife is a local). We are most excited of the
            amount of outdoor activity Utah provides, everything from hiking and camping to skiing. I also enjoy watching NFL and college football games (Carolina Panthers, since'95!) and I drink way to much coffee!</p>


        <p>I am very excited about perusing a new care in web development. I have been intently studying web design and web app development over the past year. I am very proficient with some of the popular technologies such as HTML, JS, NodeJS, AngularJS,
            Sass, Grunt and GitHub. I am currently learning Python and Django. Most of my work can be found in the profiles section. My best work is Head Coach, an HTML5 web game utilizing Phaser and Angular. It combines the best aspects of football and
            role playing into a unique experience, only found here. I am very interested in pursuing a career in the industry, feel free to drop me a line!</p>
